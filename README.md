# LLM: A Lightweight Language Model for Text Generation

## Overview

The **LLM** project is a modular implementation of a transformer-based language model for text generation. This
repository provides tools to train, evaluate, and fine-tune a lightweight language model. It's designed to handle custom
datasets and is optimized for flexibility, making it a great choice for researchers and developers experimenting with
language modeling techniques.

## Features

- Transformer-based architecture
- Support for multi-head attention and position embeddings
- Configurable hyperparameters
- Training and validation pipelines
- Integrated logging with [Weights & Biases (WandB)](https://wandb.ai/)
- Model saving and loading functionality
- Custom text generation

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.8+ and PyTorch. Install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Structure

- **`models/`**: Contains the implementation of the transformer-based language model.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions for data processing, training, and evaluation.
- **`train.py`**: Script for training the model.
- **`generate.py`**: Script for generating text using the trained model.
- **`dataset/`**: Directory to place your training datasets.
- **`saved_models/`**: Directory to save trained models.

## Usage

### Training the Model

1. Prepare your dataset as a text file (e.g., `dataset/train.txt`).
2. Set the hyperparameters in the `hyperparameters` dictionary.
3. Start training:

   ```bash
   python train.py --dataset dataset/train.txt --encoding normal --wandb_log False
   ```

   Key arguments:
    - `--dataset`: Path to the training dataset.
    - `--encoding`: Character encoding mode (`normal` or custom).
    - `--wandb_log`: Enable or disable logging with WandB.

### Generating Text

Once the model is trained, generate text using:

```bash
python generate.py --model_path saved_models/model0.pth --initial_text "Once upon a time" --max_new_tokens 100
```

Key arguments:

- `--model_path`: Path to the saved model file.
- `--initial_text`: Initial text to seed the generation.
- `--max_new_tokens`: Number of tokens to generate.

### Saving and Loading Models

Save a trained model automatically using `train_save()` or manually:

```python
from utils import save_model

save_model(model, encoding, hyperparameters)
```

Load a saved model:

```python
from utils import load_model

model, params = load_model("saved_models/model0.pth")
```

## Example Workflow

```python
from utils import train_save

hyperparameters = {
    "batch_size": 64,
    "context_length": 256,
    "max_iters": 5000,
    "eval_interval": 500,
    "learning_rate": 3e-4,
    "device": 'cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu',
    "eval_iters": 200,
    "n_embed": 384,
    "num_head": 4,
    "num_layer": 6,
    "dropout": 0.2,
    "temperature": 1.0,
    "epochs": 1,
    "train_rate": 0.9,
    "vocab_size": 256,
    "steps": 500,
    "bias": False
}

train_save(dataset_name="dataset/train.txt", encoding="normal", parameters=hyperparameters, wandb_log=True)
```

## Hyperparameters

The training process is controlled by the following hyperparameters:

| Parameter        | Description                               | Default Value |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `batch_size`     | Number of examples in each training batch | 64            |
| `context_length` | Length of the input context               | 256           |
| `max_iters`      | Maximum training iterations               | 5000          |
| `learning_rate`  | Learning rate for the optimizer           | 3e-4          |
| `n_embed`        | Embedding size                            | 384           |
| `num_head`       | Number of attention heads                 | 4             |
| `num_layer`      | Number of transformer layers              | 6             |
| `dropout`        | Dropout rate                              | 0.2           |
| `epochs`         | Number of training epochs                 | 1             |

## Logging with WandB

Enable WandB logging to visualize training metrics and generated text samples. To use WandB:

1. Install WandB:
   ```bash
   pip install wandb
   ```
2. Set up your WandB account by running:
   ```bash
   wandb login
   ```
3. Pass `wandb_log=True` when calling the training function.
